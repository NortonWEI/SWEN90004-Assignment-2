## Content
### ./readme.md
The file you currently opened
### ./original-model
The equivalent model implemented in Python
### ./extended-model
The model with extensions in new feature/behavior

Each directory contains a set of files as follows:
* ./simulator.py
    > the driver of our model
* ./models.py
    > the model implementation
* ./static_params.py
    > the static parameters that cannot be changed after each run
* ./dynamic_params.py
    > the parameters that can be adjusted after each run
* ./dynamic_params.json
    > the parameters can be changed here to take effect on the fly (Same with NetLogo)
    > the file can be generated by the program if it does not exist previously

## Run the Models
Our model requires [Python3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/) + to run.

Change directory to each model you want to run:

```sh
$ python3 simulator.py
```
After the running finishes, the output will be exported to a file named "out.csv".

## Experiments
We do not use any third party library in our project.
If you want to reproduce our experiments, please change the parameters manually in "static_params.py" or "dynamic_params.py". If the program has already run, please change the dynamic parameters in "dynamic_params.json". The "out.csv" will be replaced so please move it to a safe place before a second run.
There is no thrid-party library supported, so please import the csv to "Excel" and plot the line charts appearing in the report manually.
